# FPL_TeamSelection_Optimization (Ongoing Project)
Soccer is the most viewed sport in the world, and the Premier League is its
most popular competition. As is expected, soccer has a huge fan base and
many people like to get as much involved in the sport as possible. So it comes
as no surprise that a lot of people are involved in the Fantasy Premier League.
FPL is a game that casts you in the role of a Fantasy manager of Premier
League players. You must pick a squad of 15 players Premier League, who
score points for your team based on their performances for their clubs in
Premier League matches. Prices are given to players based on the number of
FPL points they are projected to deliver, and you have a limited budget for your
15-man squad. The objective is to achieve more points than other players.
